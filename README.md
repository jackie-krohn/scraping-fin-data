# scraping-fin-data
API and finBERT

This project was a fun way for me to play with some APIs and unstructured data and then try out some sentiment analysis with finbert, a pre-trained NLP model to analyze sentiment of financial text.

For more on the data used in this project, check out the [SEC Website](sec.gov) and EDGAR.
